    <p> This ratatouille recipe is my version of the terrific French vegetable stew made with fresh tomatoes and lots of summer vegetables. It's very versatile side dish and makes a delicious vegetarian main dish, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Garlic and oil</li>
        <li>an eggplant, two zucchini, two tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, an onion, and a red or green bell pepper</li>
        <li>dried parsley and salt</li>
        <li>A cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a skillet, cook the garlic in olive oil. Add the eggplant, parsley, and salt. </li>
        <li>Cook until the eggplant is tender, then spread the mixture in a prepared casserole dish and sprinkle with Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Spread the zucchini on top and sprinkle with more cheese. Continue layering according to the instructions in Step 3. </li>
        <li>Bake the ratatouille in the preheated oven until the vegetables are tender.</li>
    </ol>
