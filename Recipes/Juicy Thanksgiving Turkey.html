    <p> This flavorful, juicy Thanksgiving turkey is seasoned from the inside out: The cavity is stuffed with an herbaceous mixture of dried parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt. The Champagne and chicken broth, which are poured over the turkey before roasting to keep the meat incredibly moist and juicy, also add irresistible flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>

        <li> 2 tablespoons ground dried rosemary
            
        <li> 2 tablespoons rubbed dried sage
            
        <li>   2 tablespoons dried thyme leaves
            
        <li>    1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning
            
        <li>    1 tablespoon salt
            
        <li>    1 (15 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
            
        <li>    1 medium orange, cut into 8 wedges
            
        <li>    1 medium onion, chopped into large pieces
            
        <li>    1 medium carrot, cut into 1/2-inch slices
            
        <li>    2 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch slices
            
        <li>    1 (750 milliliter) bottle champagne
            
        <li>    1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
        
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roaster with sheets of aluminum foil long enough to wrap around turkey. </li>
        <li>Stir parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Rub herb mixture into turkey cavity, then stuff with orange wedges, onion, carrot, and celery. Tie turkey legs together with kitchen string, then tuck the wings under the body. </li>
        <li>Place turkey on the foil in the roasting pan. Pour champagne and chicken broth over turkey, making sure to get some liquid in the cavity.</li>
        <li>Bring aluminum foil up and over the top of turkey and seal; try to keep the foil from touching the turkey.</li>
        <li>Roast turkey in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 2 Â½ to 3 hours. Uncover turkey and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown, 30 to 60 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove turkey from the oven, cover with two sheets of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
